            <h3><b>THE MALASANA POSE</b></h3>
            <p class="fasciat"> Malasana is also called Garland Pose. It is, to put it simply, a squat. Squatting comes
                naturally to kids and people who work in the fields. However living a sedentary lifestyle 
                makes it painful and uncomfortable. This should not discourage you because it is, in fact,
                most beneficial to those with sedentary lifestyle.<br>
                You must make sure to keep your stomach and bowels empty before you practice this asana. 
                This asana activates the digestive system, tones the belly, improves the posture, increases
                flexibility in your ankles and knees.<br>
                <b>LEVEL:</b>Basic <b>STRETCHES:</b> Thighs, Hamstrings, Groin, Lower back <br>
                <b>STRENGTHENS:</b> Lower back, Hips, Digestive system

            <h3><b> FASCIAL CONDITIONING</b></h3>
            <p class="fasciat"> Fascia is a broad term for the connective tissue that weaves throughout the entire body to 
                stabilize and bind the muscles, bones, and organs together. It involves using dynamic, 
                rebounding movements to condition and reorganize our fascia into supple, reactive bands,
                dramatically increasing range of motion, athleticism, and mobility.<br>
                When fascia loses its elasticity due to inactivity, lack of mobility, or aging, our bodies
                lose their youthful bounce and we feel achy, sore and unable to perform optimally in yoga or
                other physical activities. As we move dynamically in these poses, we allow the rebound to return
                us to our neutral position. By training the fascia this way, we not only feel healthier and more
                mobile, but over time we increase our balance, proprioception, and reflex.

            <p> Revolved Head to Knee Pose is an intense seated twist pose that offers more
                benefits than a standing pose. It was designed to relieve back pain and should be performed 
                in the second half of your yoga session after your body has had time to warm up. <br>
