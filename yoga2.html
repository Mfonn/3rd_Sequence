            <h3>THE MALASANA POSE</h3>
            <p> Malasana is also called Garland Pose. It is, to put it simply, a squat. Squatting comes
                naturally to kids and people who work in the fields. However living a sedentary lifestyle 
                makes it painful and uncomfortable. This should not discourage you because it is, in fact,
                most beneficial to those with sedentary lifestyle.<br>
                You must make sure to keep your stomach and bowels empty before you practice this asana. 
                This asana activates the digestive system, tones the belly, improves the posture, increases
                flexibility in your ankles and knees.<br>
